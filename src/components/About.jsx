              ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Shobhit, a final-year CS student driven by curiosity
              and a love for creating. Iâ€™m constantly learning, growing, and
              adaptingâ€”whether itâ€™s building web apps, solving complex problems,
              or exploring new technologies. I enjoy the process as much as the
              result, and I believe in clean code, big ideas, and consistent
              effort. Beyond the screen, youâ€™ll find me chatting, walking,
              gaming, or just enjoying lifeâ€™s simple moments. I bring energy,
              creativity, and joy into everything I doâ€”whether itâ€™s coding a new
              feature or collaborating with a team. Letâ€™s connect and create
              something impactful, and fun, together! ðŸš€
